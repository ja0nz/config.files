Parsack revision history

0.4:
- parse with ports instead of string inputs
  - order of magnitude performance improvement
- switch to racket/base
- add explicit provides
- remove `State` and `Msg` structs
- user-state, expected, and unexpected parameters are global variables
- remove laziness
  - not needed since the code is largely imperative now
